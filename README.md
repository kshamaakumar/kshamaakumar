### Hi there 👋 I am Kshama

### About Me
I find my happy place in the world of data. Proficient in Python, SQL, and cloud platforms, I love optimizing workflows, creating and fine-tuning Tableau dashboards, and ensuring smooth data migrations. With a background in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Data Science, I'm here to bring a mix of theory and hands-on expertise to the table.

### The Learning Journey 🎓 
From the halls of Computer Science to the depths of Data Science, I've ventured. Now, it's all about applying that knowledge in practical, impactful ways.

### Data Adventures 💼 
While I may be a bit on the shy side, my love for data is anything but. I'm on a mission to make data not just accessible, but truly useful.
